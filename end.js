Such foods will break down very quickly. This leads to hunger pains shortly after consumption and then overconsumption of excess calories. For ectomorphs, this can result in a “skinny fat” physique. This term describes individuals that look relatively thin from the outside but carry a lot of visceral fat internally. Visceral fat consists of fat cells that pack around the organs of the body. Increased visceral fat leads to increased risk of cardiovascular issues as well as other metabolic conditions.
